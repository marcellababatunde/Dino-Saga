## Game Instructions

The goal of this game is to complete all three of the Dino-Saga levels. Use X and Y to turn the sound/music on and off, use the left stick to move your player, and use A to jump. Potions give lives and hearts while hitting enemies takes them away. The dino nuggets give points and eggs are bonuses. Watch out for slow rocks that slow you down, leaves that take points, and pits of death. To win the level reach the flag at the end of the level.
